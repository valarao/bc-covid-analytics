# BC COVID-19 Visualizations
Visualization models run on COVID-19 cases in BC updated daily.

Data extracted manually from [BC Government news releases](http://www.bccdc.ca/about/news-stories/stories/2020/information-on-novel-coronavirus). 

### Data Considerations
- There are some inconsistencies between case numbers reported on different releases.
- Region distribution of cases were not provided for March 16 and have been estimated.
